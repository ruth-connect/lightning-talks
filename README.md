# Lightning Talks
Slide decks for previous lightning talks that I have done at West Midlands Java User Group (WM-JUG) and Staffs Web Meetup.

These are in Open Office Presentation format (ODP).

The lightning talks are:

(1) CMS Development - a lightning talk for Staffs Web Meetup on a content management system (CMS) that I developed for beauty salon websites, using Java, Spring Framework, Struts 2, Hibernate, eXist-DB and PostgreSQL.

(2) Home Automation - a lightning talk for West Midlands Java User Group (WM-JUG) where I explained how to install OpenHAB (an open source home automation bus written in Java) on a Raspberry Pi 2, including setting up Oracle Java 8.

(3) Performance Testing - a lightning talk for West Midlands Java User Group (WM-JUG) on tools which can be used for Java performance testing - JMeter, VisualVM and Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT).

(4) Pet Projects - a lightning talk for West Midlands Java User Group (WM-JUG) on a couple of "pet projects" that I worked on - Salon Guinea Pig (a website for matching people who need models for hair and beauty training with people who are interested in getting free and discounted hair and beauty treatments), and Salon Alchemy (a content management system specifically designed for beauty salon websites).

(5) Thymeleaf and Thymesheet - a lightning talk for West Midlands Java User Group (WM-JUG) and Staffs Web Meetup on the Java template engine Thymeleaf, and the open-source extension Thymesheet (which Connect Group developed), which lets you specify data bindings in a separate file using CSS3 syntax.
